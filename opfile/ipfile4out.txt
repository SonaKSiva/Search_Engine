Artificial intelligence simulation human intelligence processes machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition machine vision. AI work? hype around AI accelerated, vendors been scrambling to promote their products services use it. Often, what they refer to AI simply component technology, such machine learning. AI requires foundation specialized hardware software writing training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language synonymous AI, Python, R, Java, C++ Julia features popular AI developers. general, AI systems work ingesting large amounts labeled training data, analyzing data correlations patterns, using these patterns to make predictions future states. this way, chatbot that fed examples text learn to generate lifelike exchanges people, image recognition tool learn to identify describe objects images reviewing millions examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques create realistic text, images, music other media.
