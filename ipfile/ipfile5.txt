global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth
over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered
detailed observations of various weather phenomena such as temperatures, precipitation, and
storms and of related influences on climate such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s
chemical composition. These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every
conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at
least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a growing influence over the pace and
extent of present-day climate change.
